# PacketViewerLogViewer

Note:
This Delphi version of the PVLV project is no longer supported by me.
If you want a more feature rich and up to date version, please visit the newer C# version of the project.

This program is meant to be used with .log files made with the Windower4 Packetviewer addon.
It is also able to read Ashita Packeteer .txt log files.

The program should be pretty straight forward to use for anybody for who it would be usefull.

The end idea is to make a program that can mimic the track function for the original addon, but in a offline fashion by parsing the log files

Source code is now made in Delphi 10.2 Community Edition (free version) but will likely work in other version with minimal editing.
It only uses default VCL components, so no additional components need to be installed.

Optionally uses 32bits libVLC from VideoLAN VCL if you want to use Video Linking for packets (make sure you install the 32bits version of VLC)
